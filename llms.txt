# ghapi
> A complete Python interface to GitHub's REST API that is always 100% up to date.

`ghapi` provides 100% always-updated coverage of the entire GitHub API. This is done dynamically by converting the OpenAPI spec to a Pythonic API. Using `ghapi`, you can automate nearly anything that you can do through the GitHub web interface or through the `git` client, such as:

- Open, list, comment on, or modify issues or pull requests
- Create, list, or modify git tags or GitHub releases, including uploading release assets
- Configure and run GitHub Actions and webhooks
- Set up GitHub users and organizations
- Manage your deployments
- â€¦and much, much more.

There is a one-to-one mapping between the GitHub REST API and the `ghapi` API, which you can find in the FullAPI Reference.
