    "[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions) help you automate tasks within your software development life cycle. GitHub say that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"*GitHub Actions are event-driven, meaning that you can run a series of commands after a specified event has occurred. For example, every time someone creates a pull request for a repository, you can automatically run a command that executes a software testing script.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "They are a powerful system for automating many software development processes, and open source projects get unlimited compute hours for free! A sequence of steps in GitHub Actions are be combined together into a \"workflow\", which can furthermore contain multiple \"jobs\", which are run on multiple machines, with (if needed) multiple operating systems, in parallel. For more information, read GitHub's [Introduction to GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, workflows can be difficult to create and debug, because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They run in a special environment which is difficult to replicate locally\n",
    "- Each time you make a change it takes quite a few minutes before your updated workflow is run and you can see the results\n",
    "- It is difficult to develop interatively and iteratively\n",
    "- The actions environment and contexts are complex and the documentation, whilst detailed, provides few real examples to work from\n",
    "- The main \"language\" for building workflows is a YAML-based language which is quite verbose, and doesn't allow you to leverage your knowledge of other programming languages\n",
    "- Building full-featured extensions requires using TypeScript, which is not a language that most developers are used to using for scripting, sysadmin, and continuous integration tasks.\n",
    "\n",
